foscity.dic is a dicitonary. so maybe bruteforcing will actually work this time (didn't end up using it)

we found our WP login:

Welcome to WordPress 4.3.1

alright this is admin account for WP
same creds don't work for ssh unfortunately...

changed password on account mich05654 to "password", nothing interesting there

I HOPE YOU DON'T HAVE TO KNOW A BUNCH ABOUT THE SHOW?

admin cookie: 7C33fcd5b7aabe0352f0bdbce805400e6150fef191ebb15f0dd75424c6c12f2890

action=heartbeat in one of the requests upon reload?

many metasploit modules later, no shell >:{

need a different approach...

FINALLY:
ok so you got to upload php-reverse-shell to a certain template

I picked twentyThirteen, 404-info.php

replace the theme with your php-reverse-shell

go to a page that probably does not exist:

http://ctf03.root-me.org/feed/hello

have a listener active:

so it's robot:abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz for the second shell. ok...


same key seems to be found in both daemon and robot
$ cat key-2-of-3.txt 
Congratz! You got the second key. Try to get the last one ;)

how nice of them

$ uname -r

$ ./exp

fuuuuuuuckkkkk

I did this with three different exploits, all failed as above. 

there seems to be no difference in privs between these two shells.
local privesc does not work on either....
neither did adding robot to /etc/sudoers, although idk why?

another way 3.13.0-55 can be exploited, accorind to https://www.exploit-db.com/papers/18168/, is this:
had to look this one up, but still didn't exactly work. used the below commands to finally crack it:

WOW. that was fucking hard. so basically an old version of nmap was 
installed with root. this version used to have 
an option called "--interactive" which allows for root privilages to be 
executed in the context of nmap version 3.81. weird. easily the best CTF 
I've done yet.
